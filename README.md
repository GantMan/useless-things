## Comes With:
* [\<Blink\>](#blink-tag) - Yes this classic HTML tag has a comeback tour, & it starts here.
* [TerribleName()](#terrible-names) - Need to name that uploaded file?  How about `carnival-joining-perverted-grapes.png`?
* [\<SinWave\>](#sinwave) - It's not math... it's useless!

### Blink Tag
Nostalgic for the 90s? Wish you could still have you own Geocities page? Well...
you can't... but you can recreate some of that magic and annoyance with the Blink tag!
```js
import { Blink } from 'useless-things'
import { View, Image } from 'react-native'

...

  <Blink>Hey look at me blinking!</Blink>

```

But better than the [old blink tag](http://www.montulli.org/theoriginofthe%3Cblink%3Etag)!  You can blink anything!
```js
  <Blink>
    <Image
      style={{width: 200, aspectRatio: 1}}
      source={{uri: 'https://static.pexels.com/photos/54632/cat-animal-eyes-grey-54632.jpeg'}}
    />
  </Blink>
```

### Terrible Names
Generate friendly names like `haunted effervescent twerk` for your app!  Use it for usernames, rooms, or whenever you need to assault your users with a moniker!

You can also just loop the output for some super classy _Lorem Ipsum_.

With a friendly `TerribleName` function, your customer service satisfaction can be unleashed!

```js
import { TerribleName } from 'useless-things'

const basic = TerribleName()
// result: pulsing confused fetish

const newDelimiter = TerribleName('-')
// result: acrid-haunted-furry
```
> ðŸš¨ **Pull Request Alert:** Only the most versatile yet terrible adjectives/nouns will be accepted.

This function takes one parameter; the delimiter for the resulting words.  Default value is a space.
